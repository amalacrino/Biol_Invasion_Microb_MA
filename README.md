This study is the result of the joint effort of the SP2020 class EEOB 8896.12 "Microbiome meta-analysis" held at The Ohio State University. Along with the pure ecological aspects, we focused our attention on the concept of Open Science and its positive impact on science and society. From this our decision to:

1. use publicly available data to test our hypothesis;
2. use open source tools for data analysis;
3. share the scripts we coded for data analysis;
4. share a pre-print version of our manuscript;
5. submit our manuscript to journal managed by a gold open-access publisher with open peer-review.

## Abstract 

Biological invasions impact both agricultural and natural systems. The damage can be quantified in terms of both economic loss and reduction of biodiversity. Although the literature is quite rich about the impact of invasive species on plant and animal communities, their impact on environmental microbiomes is underexplored. Here, we re-analyze publicly available data using a common framework to create a global synthesis of the effects of biological invasions on environmental microbial communities. Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and shifts in the structure of microbial populations. Therefore, the impact of biological invasions on native ecosystems might be more pervasive than previously thought, influencing both macro- and micro-biomes. We also identified gaps in the literature which encourage research on a wider variety of environments and invaders, and the influence of invaders across seasons and geographical ranges.
